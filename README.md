Gangrene, which is a medical term that refers to the decay of tissue due to a
lack of blood supply. This is more often than not due to infections, or trauma. 

This mod and mods created in relation to it, has the goal of furthering the
medical system of Project Zomboid.

# How it works (theoretically)

In the game, when a player reaches an Infection level of 10, a new moodle called
"Nasty Infection" appears alongside the corresponding status. This condition
leads to a sick state, which may eventually progress to fever and death. This
can be cured with an amputation if they fail to find and use the appropriate
medicine.
